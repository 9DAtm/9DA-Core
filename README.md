# 9DA Core

9DA Core defines the **governance protocol** for structurally coherent, ethically constrained, and audit-verifiable software ecosystems.

This repository is authoritative.

It defines:
- Architecture invariants
- Ethical capability constraints
- Dependency direction rules
- Decision traceability requirements
- Release certification mechanics

If it is not defined here, it is not part of 9DA.

## Status

**Governance protocol: FINAL**

All changes require an accepted ADR.
