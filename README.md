# 9DA Core

**Global Capability–Authority Separation SDK**  
**Normative Specification · Certification-Based Governance Framework**

---

## Status

- **Specification:** COMPLETE
- **Version:** 1.0.0
- **Implementation Status:** NONE (Specification Only)
- **License:** EVALUATION ONLY (Certification & Commercial Licensing Required for Use)

9DA Core is a **published governance specification**.  
It is ready for evaluation, certification, and licensed adoption.

---

## What Is 9DA?

9DA is a **deterministic governance and certification framework** for intelligent systems.

It defines how systems may:
- Analyze information
- Surface assumptions and constraints
- Support human understanding  

**without ever being allowed to:**
- Decide
- Recommend actions
- Optimize outcomes
- Accumulate authority
- Persist indefinitely

9DA enforces a strict separation between **capability** and **authority**.

This repository contains the **complete normative specification** required to design, audit, and certify such systems.

---

## What Does 9DA Do?

A 9DA-compliant system can:

- Surface assumptions behind claims, policies, or models
- Identify constraints, risks, and second-order effects
- Map stakeholders and impacts
- Support research and learning without authorship or persuasion
- Provide bounded institutional analysis without delegating authority
- Produce audit-verifiable records
- Terminate irreversibly on schedule

A 9DA-compliant system **cannot** decide, judge, recommend, persuade, optimize, or persist.

---

## What 9DA Is NOT

9DA is explicitly **not**:

- ❌ Software or a runnable system  
- ❌ An AI model or API  
- ❌ A hosted service  
- ❌ A decision-making tool  
- ❌ A governance substitute  
- ❌ A surveillance or monitoring system  
- ❌ An optimization or automation framework  

9DA governs **how systems are allowed to exist**, not how they are operated day-to-day.

See `docs/NON-GOALS.md`.

---

## Why 9DA Exists

As AI systems scale, they are increasingly used to **justify decisions**.

This creates systemic failures:
1. Authority quietly shifts from humans to systems  
2. Responsibility becomes ambiguous  
3. Systems persist beyond accountability  

9DA exists to prevent this.

It encodes **structural refusal**:
- The system cannot decide
- The system cannot recommend
- The system cannot optimize
- The system cannot persist
- The system must terminate

Humans remain responsible.  
Institutions remain accountable.  
Systems remain bounded.

---

## Who Should Use 9DA?

9DA is intentionally strict. It is not for everyone.

It is designed for:
- Governments and public institutions
- Universities and research organizations
- Regulators and oversight bodies
- Critical infrastructure operators
- Safety-critical and ethics-sensitive domains
- Organizations requiring audit- and court-level defensibility

If speed, autonomy, flexibility, or growth optimization is your priority, **9DA is not appropriate**.

---

## Why Choose 9DA (Despite the Rigidity)

9DA trades:

- Speed → Integrity  
- Flexibility → Verifiability  
- Automation → Accountability  
- Growth → Containment  

It is chosen when:
- You must prove AI did **not** decide
- You must retain named human responsibility
- You must withstand audits, courts, or public scrutiny
- You must guarantee termination
- You must prevent institutional dependence on AI

The rigidity is the safeguard.

---

## Example Use Cases

### Policy Analysis (Government)
A ministry analyzes a policy proposal using a 9DA-certified system.
- Assumptions and trade-offs are surfaced
- Stakeholder impacts are mapped
- No recommendation is issued
- A named human signs the final decision
- An audit trail is retained
- The system session terminates

### Research Support (University)
Researchers use a 9DA-certified system to:
- Map assumptions
- Identify contested knowledge
- Surface uncertainties  

The system:
- Claims no authorship
- Issues no conclusions
- Cannot be cited
- Retains no memory

### Regulatory Defense (Fictional)
An institution is accused of “letting AI decide.”
They present:
- A valid 9DA certificate
- Audit logs showing no decisions
- Named human accountability
- Proof of system termination  

The claim collapses.

## What You Can Do With This Repository

You may:
- Read and evaluate the specification
- Test internal prototypes
- Perform compliance self-assessment
- Prepare for certification

You may **not**:
- Deploy
- Use in production
- Publish research claims
- Market products
- Claim “inspired by” or “aligned with” 9DA

Without certification, **all usage is prohibited**.

---

## Mandatory Certification Rule

There is no “inspired by 9DA”.

Only entities holding an **official 9DA certificate** may:
- Claim compliance publicly
- Reference 9DA in products, research, or institutions
- Use the 9DA name or mark

Unauthorized claims constitute misrepresentation.

---

## How Certification Works (High Level)

1. **Evaluation**
   - Review the specification
   - Design a system that enforces all invariants

2. **Implementation (Third Party)**
   - Build your system independently
   - Enforce termination, auditability, and non-delegation

3. **Audit**
   - Architecture review
   - Schema validation
   - Invariant testing
   - Ethics and governance verification

4. **Certification**
   - Time-limited certificate issued
   - Public verification record
   - Revocable status

See `certification/CERTIFICATION-WORKFLOW.md`.

---

## Licensing Model

9DA specifications are public.  
9DA compliance is licensed and certified.

### Available Licenses

- **Certified Implementer (Paid)**  
  Right to claim compliance, time-limited certification

- **Institutional License (High Value)**  
  Ongoing audits, dispute resolution, risk shielding

- **Sovereign / Research License (Very High Value)**  
  National or international scope, custom governance, independent oversight

Compliance without certification is fraud.

## Final Statement

9DA exists to prevent structural decay under scale.

Growth without coherence is failure.  
Automation without accountability is harm.  
Governance without enforcement is theater.

If it cannot be audited, it does not count.
