This notice provides information regarding licensing availability. It does not constitute an offer, solicitation, or binding commitment to license.

\## What Is Available



The following intellectual property may be licensed:



\### 1. 9DA™ Trademark



Rights to use the "9DA" and "9DA-Compliant" trademarks in connection with compliant implementations.



\### 2. 9DA Compliance Kernel



Proprietary software for compliance verification, invariant testing, and cryptographic proof generation.



\### 3. Implementation Rights



Authorization to build, deploy, and operate implementations claiming compliance with the canonical 9DA specification.

\## Licensing Framework



\### Non-Exclusive Licensing



All licenses are non-exclusive. Multiple parties may license the same intellectual property.



\### Case-by-Case Negotiation



Licensing terms, scope, fees, and conditions are negotiated individually for each licensee. No standard published pricing is available.



\### Independent Licenses



Trademark licensing and Compliance Kernel licensing are independent. Parties may license one without the other.



\### Objective Prerequisites



Trademark licensing requires a valid compliance proof demonstrating adherence to the canonical 9DA specification. Licensing is mandatory upon satisfaction of objective compliance criteria, subject solely to execution of a license agreement.



---



\## Evaluation and Testing



\### Evaluation Use Permitted



Parties may evaluate the 9DA specification and test implementations for compliance without a license, subject to evaluation-only restrictions.



See \[EVALUATION-ONLY.md](EVALUATION-ONLY.md) for complete terms.



\### Production Use Requires License



Deployment in production environments, claims of "9DA-compliant" status, and use of the 9DA trademark require an executed license agreement.



\### No Implied Rights



Evaluation or testing does not grant rights to use the trademark, claim compliance publicly, or deploy in production.

\## Offer Submission



\### Open to Offers



The licensor is open to receiving non-binding licensing offers from interested parties.
