  "description": "Comprehensive planetary-scale governance framework for managing artificial intelligence, mental health, economic transition, and geopolitical stability through deterministic structural controls",
  "constraints": [
    "Must preserve human agency, psychological stability, and civilizational continuity under rapid technological transformation",
    "Must classify system interactions structurally without probabilistic intent inference or hidden state",
    "Must implement rule-based decision frameworks with complete auditability and traceability",
    "Must track boundary violations, extraction attempts, manipulation patterns, and system coherence as observable metrics",
    "Must function as composable governance layer compatible with existing institutional workflows",
    "Must resolve tensions between speed and safety, global coordination and local sovereignty, automation and human meaning",
    "Must integrate five parallel governance tracks: AI oversight, preventive mental health, alignment infrastructure, education-economic transition, and conflict resolution",
    "Must execute in three phases: establish guardrails (2026-2027), scale institutions (2028-2031), lock in resilience (2032-2035)",
    "Must transition from containment-focused to co-evolution frameworks as trust and maturity are demonstrated",
    "Must design incentive structures where compliance is cheaper than defection",
    "Must operate as unified architecture with shared sensing, decision, and response layers across domains",
    "Must adopt proven patterns from aviation safety, public health, and nuclear nonproliferation",
    "Must treat artificial intelligence as permanent environmental condition requiring perpetually evolving institutions",
    "Must establish international coordination body with authority over compute thresholds, capability release tiers, and emergency protocols",
    "Must mandate global registration and independent auditing of advanced AI systems",
    "Must implement planetary mental-health monitoring using anonymized psychological indicators",
    "Must require safety pipelines for frontier AI including adversarial testing, rollback capability, and legal liability",
    "Must classify all system inputs into explicit categories: valid inquiry, system extraction, contradiction forcing, constraint override, boundary simulation, or insufficient specification",
    "Must automatically refuse system extraction, constraint override, contradiction forcing, and boundary simulation attempts",
    "Must halt processing for insufficiently specified inputs requiring human clarification",
    "Must route only validated inquiries to reasoning and execution systems",
    "Must reform education systems for cognitive adaptability, ethical reasoning, and human-AI collaboration",
    "Must create economic cooperation incentives measured through transparent coordination metrics",
    "Must expand governance frameworks into binding international agreements with verification infrastructure",
    "Must deploy preventive mental-health support at workplace, educational, and community scales",
    "Must implement universal basic services and continuous learning systems as automation displaces traditional employment",
    "Must transform conflict zones into jointly administered development regions with transparent monitoring",
    "Must enable supervised policy simulation and educational personalization through aligned AI under human oversight",
    "Must institutionalize periodic stress testing across all civilizational systems",
    "Must ensure no efficiency optimization overrides human dignity or long-term survival capacity",
    "Must measure success through reduced catastrophic risk indicators",
    "Must measure success through improved global mental health baselines",
    "Must measure success through stable AI deployment without major safety incidents",
    "Must measure success through sustained productivity with declining inequality",
    "Must measure success through measurable de-escalation of violent conflicts",
    "Must condition expansion beyond Earth on demonstrated closed-loop life support and conflict containment",
    "Must implement mandatory registration and real-time telemetry for high-risk systems",
    "Must trigger automatic constraint enforcement when safety thresholds are exceeded",
    "Must enforce boundary integrity through explicit limits, capacity constraints, and synchronization requirements",
    "Must operate as continuous adaptive loop: sense conditions, optimize conversion, balance storage, distribute resources, restore stability, update operational rules"
