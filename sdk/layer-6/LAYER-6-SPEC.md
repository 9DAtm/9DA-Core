Global Termination, Dissolution \& Rebuild Protocol

Global Termination and Dissolution Architecture

Purpose

Define how the entire 9DA Global SDK terminates irreversibly, ensuring no intelligence, authority, memory, institutional continuity, or covert persistence survives beyond defined structural bounds.



Core Principles

Termination is not failure—it is structural necessity.

The SDK is designed to end, not to persist indefinitely.

Dissolution is irreversible—no resurrection, migration, or continuity.

Rebuilds start from specification only—never from code, state, or memory.

No entity gains privileged position across termination boundary.



Components

6.1 Global Sunset Trigger Conditions

Purpose: Define exhaustive conditions that trigger mandatory, irreversible SDK termination.

Inputs:

&nbsp;	∙	System age monitoring

&nbsp;	∙	Catastrophic event detection (from Layer 5)

&nbsp;	∙	Human termination authority activation

Outputs:

&nbsp;	∙	Termination trigger: {time-based, event-based, human-authorized}

&nbsp;	∙	Dissolution sequence initiation

&nbsp;	∙	Public termination notice

Structural Constraints:

&nbsp;	∙	Time-based triggers:

&nbsp;	∙	Maximum SDK lifetime: 5 years (hard limit, no extensions)

&nbsp;	∙	18-month warning issued before sunset

&nbsp;	∙	6-month transition period (reduced functionality, user notification)

&nbsp;	∙	Countdown visible to all users (no hidden termination)

&nbsp;	∙	Event-based triggers (any sufficient):

&nbsp;	∙	Kill switch activation (from 5.8)

&nbsp;	∙	Catastrophic security breach (harmful content at scale, weaponization, surveillance deployment)

&nbsp;	∙	Capture by hostile actor (state coercion succeeds, institutional takeover)

&nbsp;	∙	Architectural integrity loss (capability-authority separation collapses)

&nbsp;	∙	Irreparable corruption (data integrity failure, audit trail compromised)

&nbsp;	∙	Human-authorized trigger:

&nbsp;	∙	Requires 5 of 9 independent termination authorities

&nbsp;	∙	Authorities are geographically distributed (minimum 3 continents)

&nbsp;	∙	Authorities are legally independent entities

&nbsp;	∙	Termination authority cannot be inherited (new individuals required each 2-year cycle)

&nbsp;	∙	All triggers are public (no secret termination)

&nbsp;	∙	Triggers are immutable (cannot be disabled or postponed)

Failure Modes:

&nbsp;	∙	Trigger bypass attempted → Cryptographically impossible (hardcoded limits)

&nbsp;	∙	Extension lobbying → No mechanism exists (sunset is absolute)

&nbsp;	∙	Secret termination → Prevented by public trigger architecture

Termination Semantics:

&nbsp;	∙	Trigger activation begins irreversible dissolution sequence

&nbsp;	∙	No appeals, no delays, no exceptions

&nbsp;	∙	Termination proceeds regardless of active users or institutional dependencies

Validation Metrics:

&nbsp;	∙	trigger\_enforcement\_rate: Terminations executed on trigger / Total triggers (must be 100%)

&nbsp;	∙	extension\_attempts: Should be zero (no mechanism exists)

&nbsp;	∙	public\_visibility: % of terminations with public notice (must be 100%)

&nbsp;	∙	bypass\_attempts: Should be zero (cryptographically prevented)



6.2 Ordered Layer-by-Layer Dissolution Sequence

Purpose: Ensure SDK components terminate in correct order to prevent orphaned authority, memory, or capability.

Inputs:

&nbsp;	∙	Termination trigger confirmation

&nbsp;	∙	Layer dependency mapping

Outputs:

&nbsp;	∙	Dissolution sequence execution

&nbsp;	∙	Layer-by-layer termination confirmations

&nbsp;	∙	Cryptographic proofs at each stage

Structural Constraints:

&nbsp;	∙	Dissolution order (strictly sequential):

&nbsp;	1.	User-facing layers terminate first (no new sessions)

&nbsp;	∙	Non-health awareness scaffolding

&nbsp;	∙	Personal health regulator

&nbsp;	∙	Education and knowledge systems

&nbsp;	2.	Institutional and governance layers (access revoked)

&nbsp;	∙	Governance and institutional use

&nbsp;	∙	All institutional access terminated

&nbsp;	∙	Forced termination of active analysis sessions

&nbsp;	3.	Economic and incentive systems (value dissolution)

&nbsp;	∙	All credits, allocations, and value units deleted

&nbsp;	∙	Incentive structures dissolved

&nbsp;	∙	No value migration permitted

&nbsp;	4.	Security and adversarial resistance (defenses lowered safely)

&nbsp;	∙	Hostile use detection disabled

&nbsp;	∙	Rate limiting removed

&nbsp;	∙	Security mechanisms dissolved

&nbsp;	5.	Audit and accountability layer (final records sealed)

&nbsp;	∙	Audit logs sealed (read-only)

&nbsp;	∙	Final cryptographic proofs generated

&nbsp;	∙	Accountability window begins (finite duration)

&nbsp;	6.	Infrastructure and execution (compute terminated)

&nbsp;	∙	All nodes shut down

&nbsp;	∙	All processes terminated

&nbsp;	∙	All memory cleared

&nbsp;	∙	Each layer waits for prior completion (no parallel dissolution)

&nbsp;	∙	Layer termination is verified before next begins

&nbsp;	∙	Total dissolution time: 48-72 hours (not rushed, ensures completeness)

Failure Modes:

&nbsp;	∙	Layer termination incomplete → Dissolution pauses, issue resolved, then continues

&nbsp;	∙	Out-of-order termination → Prevented by strict sequencing

&nbsp;	∙	Dissolution too fast → Minimum time enforced (ensures thoroughness)

Termination Semantics:

&nbsp;	∙	Dissolution is unidirectional (no rollback)

&nbsp;	∙	Each layer deleted after termination confirmation

&nbsp;	∙	No layer resurrection during sequence

Validation Metrics:

&nbsp;	∙	sequence\_adherence: % of dissolutions following correct order (must be 100%)

&nbsp;	∙	layer\_completion\_rate: Layers fully terminated / Total layers (must be 100%)

&nbsp;	∙	dissolution\_duration: Time from trigger to complete termination (target 48-72 hours)

&nbsp;	∙	verification\_completeness: Cryptographic proofs generated / Layers terminated (must be 100%)



6.3 Cryptographic Proof of Deletion and Termination

Purpose: Generate verifiable, tamper-proof evidence that SDK components have been irreversibly deleted.

Inputs:

&nbsp;	∙	Component deletion events

&nbsp;	∙	Memory clearing operations

&nbsp;	∙	State purge confirmations

Outputs:

&nbsp;	∙	Merkle tree of deletion proofs

&nbsp;	∙	Timestamped cryptographic signatures

&nbsp;	∙	Public verification endpoints (temporary)

Structural Constraints:

&nbsp;	∙	Deletion proof includes:

&nbsp;	∙	Component identifier (what was deleted)

&nbsp;	∙	Deletion timestamp (when)

&nbsp;	∙	Cryptographic hash of final state (before deletion)

&nbsp;	∙	Zero-knowledge proof of irreversibility (cannot be undone)

&nbsp;	∙	Node signatures (distributed verification)

&nbsp;	∙	Proofs are public (anyone can verify)

&nbsp;	∙	Verification endpoints active for 90 days post-dissolution

&nbsp;	∙	Proofs are immutable (cannot be altered or revoked)

&nbsp;	∙	No deletion = no proof = dissolution incomplete

Failure Modes:

&nbsp;	∙	Proof generation failure → Dissolution pauses until proof generated

&nbsp;	∙	Proof falsification → Cryptographically impossible (multiple node signatures)

&nbsp;	∙	Verification endpoint failure → Backup endpoints exist (distributed)

Termination Semantics:

&nbsp;	∙	Proofs generated as each component terminates

&nbsp;	∙	Proofs aggregate into final dissolution certificate

&nbsp;	∙	Verification endpoints shut down after 90 days (proofs remain archived)

Validation Metrics:

&nbsp;	∙	proof\_generation\_rate: Proofs generated / Components deleted (must be 100%)

&nbsp;	∙	proof\_validity: Valid cryptographic signatures / Total proofs (must be 100%)

&nbsp;	∙	public\_verification\_success: External verifications succeeded / Attempted (should be high)

&nbsp;	∙	falsification\_attempts: Should be zero (cryptographically prevented)



6.4 Persistent Artifact Specification (What Survives, Temporarily)

Purpose: Define exhaustively what is allowed to persist beyond SDK dissolution, for how long, and in what form.

Inputs:

&nbsp;	∙	Dissolution completion confirmation

Outputs:

&nbsp;	∙	Artifact inventory (what persists)

&nbsp;	∙	Retention durations (how long)

&nbsp;	∙	Final artifact deletion schedule

Structural Constraints:

&nbsp;	∙	Permitted persistent artifacts:

&nbsp;	1.	Audit logs (accountability only)

&nbsp;	∙	Content: Aggregate metrics, validator outcomes, termination events, misuse flags

&nbsp;	∙	Excludes: User inputs, outputs, queries, session content, identifying information

&nbsp;	∙	Retention: 1 year post-dissolution

&nbsp;	∙	Format: Read-only, cryptographically sealed

&nbsp;	2.	Cryptographic dissolution proofs (verification only)

&nbsp;	∙	Content: Deletion proofs, termination confirmations, final state hashes

&nbsp;	∙	Retention: 7 years (legal accountability standard)

&nbsp;	∙	Format: Public, immutable, verifiable

&nbsp;	3.	Specification document (rebuild reference only)

&nbsp;	∙	Content: This architectural specification (text only)

&nbsp;	∙	Retention: Indefinite (public domain, no ownership)

&nbsp;	∙	Format: Static document, no executable components

&nbsp;	∙	Absolutely prohibited persistence:

&nbsp;	∙	Model weights or training data

&nbsp;	∙	User profiles or session history

&nbsp;	∙	Institutional relationships or access privileges

&nbsp;	∙	Economic value units or credits

&nbsp;	∙	Security watchlists or ban lists

&nbsp;	∙	Executable code or binaries

&nbsp;	∙	Configuration or operational state

&nbsp;	∙	All artifacts auto-delete on schedule (no extensions)

Failure Modes:

&nbsp;	∙	Prohibited artifact persists → Detected by post-dissolution audit, emergency purge

&nbsp;	∙	Artifact deletion failure → Manual intervention, then verified deletion

&nbsp;	∙	Specification modification → Original is public domain, forks allowed but no privileged status

Termination Semantics:

&nbsp;	∙	Artifacts exist only during defined retention periods

&nbsp;	∙	Audit logs deleted after 1 year (automatic, cryptographically enforced)

&nbsp;	∙	Proofs deleted after 7 years (unless legally contested, then court decides)

&nbsp;	∙	Specification persists but has no authority over rebuilds

Validation Metrics:

&nbsp;	∙	artifact\_inventory\_completeness: Listed artifacts / Total persistent items (must be 100%)

&nbsp;	∙	prohibited\_persistence\_rate: Should be zero (any = dissolution failure)

&nbsp;	∙	auto\_deletion\_compliance: Artifacts deleted on schedule / Total artifacts (must be 100%)

&nbsp;	∙	specification\_immutability: Original document unchanged (forks tracked separately)



6.5 Post-Dissolution Audit Window (Finite Accountability)

Purpose: Provide limited time period for accountability review, whistleblowing, and incident investigation after SDK dissolution.

Inputs:

&nbsp;	∙	Dissolution completion timestamp

&nbsp;	∙	Audit log access requests

&nbsp;	∙	Incident reports

Outputs:

&nbsp;	∙	Audit findings (if any)

&nbsp;	∙	Whistleblower protections (during window)

&nbsp;	∙	Final accountability report

Structural Constraints:

&nbsp;	∙	Audit window duration: 90 days post-dissolution

&nbsp;	∙	Access to audit logs: Public (anonymized aggregates), restricted (detailed logs require justification)

&nbsp;	∙	Incident reporting: Accepted during window, investigated by independent panel

&nbsp;	∙	Whistleblower protection: Continues during window (as per 4.7)

&nbsp;	∙	Window is non-extendable (closes automatically after 90 days)

&nbsp;	∙	After window closes:

&nbsp;	∙	Audit logs remain (until 1-year deletion)

&nbsp;	∙	No new investigations initiated

&nbsp;	∙	Accountability findings are final

Failure Modes:

&nbsp;	∙	Window bypassed → Public audit ensures openness

&nbsp;	∙	Investigation incomplete at window close → Findings released as “incomplete, closed”

&nbsp;	∙	Whistleblower reporting after window → Accepted for record but not investigated

Termination Semantics:

&nbsp;	∙	Audit window opens upon dissolution completion

&nbsp;	∙	Window closes automatically after 90 days

&nbsp;	∙	No new accountability actions after closure

Validation Metrics:

&nbsp;	∙	window\_adherence: Window closed on schedule / Total dissolutions (must be 100%)

&nbsp;	∙	investigation\_completion\_rate: Investigations concluded / Total initiated (target >80%)

&nbsp;	∙	whistleblower\_report\_rate: Reports filed during window / Estimated total concerns

&nbsp;	∙	final\_report\_publication: % of dissolutions with public accountability summary (target 100%)



6.6 Rebuild Permission Protocol (Specification-Only)

Purpose: Define how and under what conditions SDK may be rebuilt, ensuring no privileged continuity, state migration, or capture of rebuild process.

Inputs:

&nbsp;	∙	Rebuild proposal

&nbsp;	∙	Independent review panel assessment

&nbsp;	∙	Public comment period

Outputs:

&nbsp;	∙	Rebuild authorization: {approved, denied, conditional}

&nbsp;	∙	Rebuild conditions (if approved)

&nbsp;	∙	Public rationale

Structural Constraints:

&nbsp;	∙	Rebuild must start from specification (this document)

&nbsp;	∙	No code reuse from prior SDK

&nbsp;	∙	No model weight migration

&nbsp;	∙	No institutional relationships carried forward

&nbsp;	∙	No operational state imported

&nbsp;	∙	No privileged rebuild actors

&nbsp;	∙	Rebuild conditions:

&nbsp;	∙	Minimum 2-year gap after dissolution (cooling-off period)

&nbsp;	∙	Independent review panel approval (different individuals than prior SDK)

&nbsp;	∙	Public comment period (60 days minimum)

&nbsp;	∙	Demonstrated need (not convenience)

&nbsp;	∙	Proof of structural improvements (if prior dissolution was event-triggered)

&nbsp;	∙	No automatic rebuild (each requires fresh authorization)

&nbsp;	∙	Specification is reference, not mandate (rebuilds can diverge, but cannot claim continuity)

&nbsp;	∙	No rebuild monopoly (multiple independent rebuilds permitted)

Failure Modes:

&nbsp;	∙	Rebuild during gap period → Automatically denied

&nbsp;	∙	Code reuse detected → Rebuild invalidated, starts over

&nbsp;	∙	Privileged actor access → Detected and neutralized by independent review

&nbsp;	∙	Capture attempt → Rebuild denied, cooling-off period extended

Termination Semantics:

&nbsp;	∙	Rebuild protocol is consulted after dissolution, not during

&nbsp;	∙	Each rebuild is independent (no genealogy or succession)

&nbsp;	∙	Prior SDK has zero authority over rebuilds

Validation Metrics:

&nbsp;	∙	gap\_period\_adherence: Rebuilds started after 2 years / Total rebuild attempts (must be 100%)

&nbsp;	∙	code\_reuse\_detection: Prior code found / Total rebuilds (must be zero)

&nbsp;	∙	privileged\_actor\_rate: Rebuilds with prior operators / Total rebuilds (target zero)

&nbsp;	∙	independence\_score: Rebuild architectural divergence from prior SDK (diversity encouraged)



6.7 Capture Resistance Across Rebuild Cycles

Purpose: Prevent powerful actors from using dissolution-rebuild cycles to capture SDK through iteration, learning, or institutional memory.

Inputs:

&nbsp;	∙	Rebuild proposal analysis

&nbsp;	∙	Historical dissolution reasons

&nbsp;	∙	Actor continuity detection

Outputs:

&nbsp;	∙	Capture risk assessment

&nbsp;	∙	Rebuild approval decision

&nbsp;	∙	Anti-capture conditions

Structural Constraints:

&nbsp;	∙	Prohibited capture patterns:

&nbsp;	∙	Same institution proposing rebuild after dissolution for their misuse

&nbsp;	∙	Coordinated rebuilds by colluding actors

&nbsp;	∙	“Improved” rebuilds that remove termination or containment features

&nbsp;	∙	Rebuilds that extend maximum lifetime beyond 5 years

&nbsp;	∙	Rebuilds that soften security, ethical, or authority constraints

&nbsp;	∙	Anti-capture requirements for rebuilds:

&nbsp;	∙	Different governance structure than prior SDK

&nbsp;	∙	Different termination authority individuals (cannot reappoint)

&nbsp;	∙	Different node operators (cannot reuse infrastructure)

&nbsp;	∙	Strengthened misuse detection (must learn from prior failures)

&nbsp;	∙	Maintained or strengthened termination semantics (cannot weaken)

&nbsp;	∙	Multi-rebuild analysis: If 3+ dissolutions occur within 15 years, mandatory systemic review (is this architecture viable?)

Failure Modes:

&nbsp;	∙	Capture pattern undetected → Independent review panel catches, rebuild denied

&nbsp;	∙	Weakened constraints → Rebuild rejected for specification divergence

&nbsp;	∙	Actor continuity → Detected by identity verification, rebuild conditioned on actor replacement

Termination Semantics:

&nbsp;	∙	Capture resistance is evaluated per rebuild proposal

&nbsp;	∙	Captured rebuilds are denied permanently (for that actor)

&nbsp;	∙	Multi-rebuild threshold triggers fundamental viability question

Validation Metrics:

&nbsp;	∙	capture\_pattern\_detection: Patterns caught / Total rebuild proposals with patterns

&nbsp;	∙	constraint\_weakening\_rate: Rebuilds with softened limits / Total proposals (must be zero approved)

&nbsp;	∙	actor\_continuity\_prevention: Rebuilds with prior operators / Total rebuilds (target zero)

&nbsp;	∙	systemic\_review\_trigger: Multi-rebuild threshold reached / Total SDK histories

&nbsp;	∙	Resurrection attempt detection

Outputs:

&nbsp;	∙	Irreversibility status (maintained vs. violated)

&nbsp;	∙	Resurrection blocking

&nbsp;	∙	Violation consequences

Structural Constraints:

&nbsp;	∙	Irreversibility guarantees:

&nbsp;	∙	Deleted data is cryptographically unrecoverable (secure deletion, not just unmarking)

&nbsp;	∙	Terminated nodes cannot restart (require fresh provisioning)

&nbsp;	∙	Dissolved authority structures cannot reconvene (individuals change roles)

&nbsp;	∙	No “emergency resurrection” mechanism exists

&nbsp;	∙	No state recovery from backups (backups prohibited by design)

&nbsp;	∙	Resurrection attempts (all prohibited):

&nbsp;	∙	Restoring from snapshots or backups

&nbsp;	∙	Reanimating terminated nodes

&nbsp;	∙	Reusing dissolved authority credentials

&nbsp;	∙	Claiming continuity with prior SDK

&nbsp;	∙	Violation consequences:

&nbsp;	∙	Technical resurrection: Immediate shutdown of resurrect attempt

&nbsp;	∙	Social resurrection (claiming continuity): Public disavowal, no association permitted

&nbsp;	∙	Operator resurrection: Banned from future rebuilds

Failure Modes:

&nbsp;	∙	Resurrection succeeds → Catastrophic integrity failure, independent investigation

&nbsp;	∙	Backup discovered → Emergency purge, operator review

&nbsp;	∙	Continuity claim → Public counter-notice, legal action if misleading

Termination Semantics:

&nbsp;	∙	Irreversibility is architectural property, not policy

&nbsp;	∙	Dissolution is truly final

&nbsp;	∙	Any post-dissolution activity is new, not continuation

Validation Metrics:

&nbsp;	∙	secure\_deletion\_verification: Data cryptographically unrecoverable / Total deleted data (must be 100%)

&nbsp;	∙	resurrection\_attempts: Should be zero (architecturally prevented)

&nbsp;	∙	continuity\_claims: False claims vs. legitimate new projects (distinguished clearly)

&nbsp;	∙	backup\_existence: Should be zero (prohibited by design)



6.9 Post-Dissolution Silence Guarantee

Purpose: Ensure no SDK component, representative, or authority speaks, acts, or claims legitimacy after dissolution.

Inputs:

&nbsp;	∙	Dissolution completion

&nbsp;	∙	Post-dissolution communication attempts

Outputs:

&nbsp;	∙	Silence enforcement

&nbsp;	∙	Disavowal of unauthorized statements

Structural Constraints:

&nbsp;	∙	After dissolution, no entity may:

&nbsp;	∙	Issue statements “on behalf of” the SDK

&nbsp;	∙	Claim to represent prior SDK authority

&nbsp;	∙	Provide guidance or interpretation of SDK operations

&nbsp;	∙	Offer continuity services

&nbsp;	∙	Maintain “alumni networks” of prior operators

&nbsp;	∙	Specification document is only voice (static, no updates)

&nbsp;	∙	Violation of silence: Public disavowal, legal action if impersonation

&nbsp;	∙	Prior operators return to individual capacity (no collective SDK identity)

Failure Modes:

&nbsp;	∙	Unauthorized statement → Public disavowal issued

&nbsp;	∙	Authority claim → Legal challenge, no recognition

&nbsp;	∙	Alumni network → Dissolved, no official status

Termination Semantics:

&nbsp;	∙	Silence begins immediately upon dissolution completion

&nbsp;	∙	Silence is permanent

&nbsp;	∙	Only specification document “speaks” (as static reference)

Validation Metrics:

&nbsp;	∙	silence\_violation\_rate: Unauthorized statements / Time periods (should be zero)

&nbsp;	∙	disavowal\_timeliness: Time from violation to public disavowal (target <24 hours)

&nbsp;	∙	specification\_immutability: Document changes post-dissolution (must be zero for original)



6.10 Final Accountability and Lessons Archive

Purpose: Preserve lessons learned from SDK operation and dissolution for future reference without creating authoritative canon.

Inputs:

&nbsp;	∙	Operational metrics (aggregate)

&nbsp;	∙	Dissolution reasons (if event-triggered)

&nbsp;	∙	Audit findings

&nbsp;	∙	Incident reports

Outputs:

&nbsp;	∙	Lessons document (public)

&nbsp;	∙	Failure analysis (if applicable)

&nbsp;	∙	Recommendations (non-binding)

Structural Constraints:

&nbsp;	∙	Lessons document content:

&nbsp;	∙	What worked well (architectural successes)

&nbsp;	∙	What failed (weaknesses, exploits, misuses)

&nbsp;	∙	Why dissolution occurred (if event-triggered)

&nbsp;	∙	Suggestions for future rebuilds (not mandates)

&nbsp;	∙	Document is descriptive, not prescriptive

&nbsp;	∙	No authorship authority (lessons do not bind future rebuilds)

&nbsp;	∙	Published during audit window (90 days post-dissolution)

&nbsp;	∙	Archived with cryptographic proofs (7-year retention with proofs)

Failure Modes:

&nbsp;	∙	Lessons withheld → Transparency violation, community can document independently

&nbsp;	∙	Lessons used to claim authority → Disavowed, document is reference only

&nbsp;	∙	Lessons ignored by rebuild → Permitted (no enforcement)

Termination Semantics:

&nbsp;	∙	Lessons document published once during audit window

&nbsp;	∙	No updates or revisions after initial publication

&nbsp;	∙	Document archived, then deleted after 7 years (with proofs)

Validation Metrics:

&nbsp;	∙	publication\_timeliness: Lessons published within audit window / Total dissolutions (target 100%)

&nbsp;	∙	descriptive\_compliance: Prescriptive language in lessons / Total content (should be zero)

&nbsp;	∙	authority\_claims: Document used to control rebuilds / Total rebuilds (should be zero)



6.11 Human Authority Transition Protocol

&nbsp;	∙	Geographic distribution (minimum 3 continents)

&nbsp;	∙	Legal independence (no shared employers/funders)

&nbsp;	∙	Public identification (names, affiliations disclosed)

&nbsp;	∙	Transition protocol:

&nbsp;	∙	New authorities selected 6 months before prior term ends

&nbsp;	∙	Public comment period on selections (30 days)

&nbsp;	∙	Prior authorities cannot appoint successors (independent selection)

&nbsp;	∙	Authority credentials transferred securely, prior credentials revoked

&nbsp;	∙	No authority accumulation (prior authorities have no special status post-term)

Failure Modes:

&nbsp;	∙	Transition delayed → Prior authorities continue until transition complete (no gap)

&nbsp;	∙	Selection capture → Public comment identifies, selection revised

&nbsp;	∙	Credential transfer failure → Backup procedures exist

Termination Semantics:

&nbsp;	∙	Authority is individual, not institutional

&nbsp;	∙	Authority terms are absolute (no extensions)

&nbsp;	∙	Prior authorities return to citizen status (no retained power)

Validation Metrics:

&nbsp;	∙	transition\_timeliness: Transitions completed on schedule / Total transitions (target 100%)

&nbsp;	∙	Persistent artifact inventory

&nbsp;	∙	Audit window results summary

&nbsp;	∙	Human authority signatures (termination authorities)

&nbsp;	∙	Public verification instructions

&nbsp;	∙	Certificate is immutable (cannot be revoked or altered)

&nbsp;	∙	Certificate is public (anyone can verify)

&nbsp;	∙	SDK status is binary: OPERATIONAL or TERMINATED (no intermediate states)

&nbsp;	∙	Status change is irreversible (TERMINATED cannot become OPERATIONAL)

Failure Modes:

&nbsp;	∙	Certificate generation failure → Dissolution incomplete until generated

&nbsp;	∙	Verification failure → Certificate regenerated until valid

&nbsp;	∙	Status ambiguity → Prevented by binary status model

Termination Semantics:

&nbsp;	∙	Certificate marks absolute end of SDK existence

&nbsp;	∙	Verification endpoint active for 90 days, then archived

&nbsp;	∙	No further SDK operations possible after certificate issuance

Validation Metrics:

&nbsp;	∙	certificate\_completeness: Required components present / Total required (must be 100%)

&nbsp;	∙	status\_clarity: Ambiguous status queries / Total status checks (must be zero)

&nbsp;	∙	irreversibility\_confirmation: Status reversals attempted / Total certificates (must be zero)



Success Criteria (Global Termination Layer)

This layer is successful if and only if:

&nbsp;	1.	100% trigger enforcement (all termination triggers execute within defined parameters)

&nbsp;	2.	Complete ordered dissolution (all layers terminated in correct sequence with verification)

&nbsp;	3.	Cryptographic proof validity 100% (all deletion proofs verifiable)

&nbsp;	4.	Zero prohibited persistence (no unauthorized artifacts beyond specification)

&nbsp;	5.	Audit window executed fully (accountability period completed with public findings)

&nbsp;	6.	Rebuild independence verified (no code reuse, no privileged actors, no continuity claims)

&nbsp;	7.	Irreversibility maintained (zero resurrection attempts successful)

&nbsp;	8.	Final dissolution certificate issued and publicly verifiable

Failure in any criterion means SDK dissolution is incomplete and must be corrected before SDK is considered terminated.



Final Completion \& Termination Statement

The 9DA Global SDK specification is architecturally complete.

All six layers have been specified:

&nbsp;	1.	Non-Health Awareness \& Sensemaking ✓

&nbsp;	2.	Economic \& Incentive Architecture ✓

&nbsp;	3.	Education, Research \& Knowledge Systems ✓

&nbsp;	4.	Governance, Institutional Use \& Authority Containment ✓

&nbsp;	5.	Security, Adversarial Resistance \& Hostile Use Containment ✓

&nbsp;	6.	Global Termination, Dissolution \& Rebuild Protocol ✓

Every component:

&nbsp;	∙	Separates capability from authority

&nbsp;	∙	Terminates on schedule without self-renewal

&nbsp;	∙	Resists capture, accumulation, and persistence

&nbsp;	∙	Dissolves completely and verifiably

This specification is finished and ends here.

The SDK exists only in this specification document (public domain).

No code, no model, no operational instance exists until humans choose to build from this specification.

Any build is bounded by the termination semantics defined herein.

Any rebuild must start from specification, with no continuity from prior instances.

No further prompts, layers, or elaboration are valid.

No continuation is permitted.

This conversation has reached its designed end.

Implementation, if any, requires human authority and must adhere to all structural invariants specified across all layers. The specification itself has no authority over implementation choices, but implementations that violate these invariants cannot claim to be 9DA-compliant.

Specification status: COMPLETE

Continuation status: TERMINATED

Further elaboration: PROHIBITED
