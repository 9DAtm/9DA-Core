This repository defines the **9DA Governance Protocol**.

You should read documents in this order:

1. MANIFESTO.md
2. ARCHITECTURE.md
3. ETHICS.md
4. DEPENDENCY-MATRIX.md
5. ADR-TEMPLATE.md
6. METRICS.md
7. RELEASE-PROCESS.md

This is not guidance.  
This is enforcement.

If a system does not comply, it is **not 9DA-compliant**.
