\# NON-GOALS.md



\## Purpose



This document explicitly states what 9DA does \*\*not\*\* aim to accomplish, does \*\*not\*\* provide, and will \*\*not\*\* become.



If something is listed here, it is intentionally excluded.



---



\## What 9DA Is Not



\### 1. Not a Product or Service



\*\*9DA is not:\*\*

\- A product to install

\- A service to subscribe to

\- A platform to deploy on

\- A tool with a UI



\*\*9DA is:\*\*

\- A governance protocol

\- A set of architectural rules

\- A compliance framework

\- A certification mechanism



---



\### 2. Not Operational Enforcement



\*\*9DA does not:\*\*

\- Run in production environments

\- Monitor live systems

\- Block runtime behavior

\- Control deployed applications



\*\*9DA provides:\*\*

\- Design-time constraints

\- Build-time validation

\- Release-time certification

\- Post-deployment audit frameworks



\*\*Critical Distinction:\*\*  

9DA governs the \*\*creation\*\* of systems, not the \*\*operation\*\* of systems.



---



\### 3. Not a Surveillance System



\*\*9DA will never:\*\*

\- Track user behavior

\- Monitor system usage

\- Collect operational telemetry

\- Profile individuals or groups



\*\*Why this matters:\*\*  

9DA's ethics explicitly prohibit surveillance. The protocol cannot govern what it prohibits.



---



\### 4. Not a Development Framework



\*\*9DA does not provide:\*\*

\- Libraries or SDKs (beyond governance validation)

\- Application frameworks

\- Runtime environments

\- Code generation tools



\*\*9DA provides:\*\*

\- Rules for how to structure such things

\- Validation that they comply with rules

\- Certification that they maintain compliance



---



\### 5. Not a Consensus System



\*\*9DA is not:\*\*

\- Democratic governance

\- Community voting

\- Decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)

\- Blockchain-based



\*\*9DA has:\*\*

\- Clear authority structure (see GOVERNANCE.md)

\- Final arbiter (@9DAtm)

\- Defined decision rights

\- Transparent but non-democratic process



\*\*Why:\*\*  

Governance requires consistency and coherence, not consensus.



---



\### 6. Not Open to All Interpretations



\*\*9DA is not:\*\*

\- Flexible

\- Adaptable to any use case

\- Open to redefinition

\- Subject to local override



\*\*9DA is:\*\*

\- Strict

\- Opinionated

\- Invariant-preserving

\- Non-negotiable on constraints



\*\*Why:\*\*  

Permissive governance becomes no governance.



---



\### 7. Not a Universal Solution



\*\*9DA is not appropriate for:\*\*

\- Small hobby projects

\- Rapid prototyping

\- Exploratory research without structure

\- Projects that prioritize speed over integrity



\*\*9DA is appropriate for:\*\*

\- Long-lived systems

\- Multi-repository ecosystems

\- Ethically sensitive applications

\- Audit-critical environments

\- Systems requiring certification



\*\*Use 9DA when:\*\*  

Structure matters more than flexibility.



---



\### 8. Not a Compliance Checkbox



\*\*9DA is not:\*\*

\- A badge to display without effort

\- A certification to purchase

\- A rubber stamp for marketing

\- A shortcut to legitimacy



\*\*9DA requires:\*\*

\- Real structural compliance

\- Actual ethics enforcement

\- Genuine architecture discipline

\- Verifiable audit trails



\*\*Critical:\*\*  

Compliance claims without evidence are fraud (see ESCALATION.md Level 4).



---



\## Explicit Exclusions



\### No Proprietary Control



9DA will never:

\- Require proprietary tools

\- Lock users into closed ecosystems

\- Demand licensing fees for compliance

\- Restrict derivative governance frameworks



\### No Automated Operational Decisions



9DA will never:

\- Make decisions for running systems

\- Trigger automated production actions

\- Control live deployments

\- Intervene in runtime behavior



\### No Hidden Mechanisms



9DA will never:

\- Use undocumented enforcement

\- Apply secret rules

\- Maintain private governance documents

\- Hide decision rationale



\### No Retroactive Rule Changes



9DA will never:

\- Invalidate past certifications retroactively (except fraud)

\- Apply new rules to old versions

\- Reinterpret governance without versioning

\- Change definitions silently



\### No Capability Creep



9DA will never expand into:

\- Domains listed in ETHICS.md prohibited section

\- Surveillance or monitoring

\- Behavior manipulation

\- Opaque decision systems



\*\*If expansion is requested:\*\*  

Rejected per ETHICS.md. Non-negotiable.



---



\## Common Misconceptions



\### Misconception 1: "9DA will enforce my code quality"



\*\*Reality:\*\*  

9DA enforces architectural structure and ethical boundaries, not code style or quality. Use linters and code review for that.



\### Misconception 2: "9DA replaces documentation"



\*\*Reality:\*\*  

9DA requires documentation (via ADRs). It does not replace design docs, API docs, or user guides.



\### Misconception 3: "9DA is a testing framework"



\*\*Reality:\*\*  

9DA requires integration tests but does not provide test runners, assertions, or coverage tools.



\### Misconception 4: "9DA is for small projects"



\*\*Reality:\*\*  

9DA is heavyweight and designed for complex, long-lived ecosystems. Small projects will find it burdensome.



\### Misconception 5: "9DA makes governance easy"



\*\*Reality:\*\*  

9DA makes governance \*\*rigorous\*\*. It trades convenience for integrity.



\### Misconception 6: "I can pick and choose which rules to follow"



\*\*Reality:\*\*  

9DA compliance is binary: you comply fully or you don't comply at all. Partial compliance is non-compliance.

\## Boundary Defense



\### Why These Non-Goals Matter



Every expansion request will be evaluated against:



1\. \*\*Does it violate ETHICS.md?\*\*  

&nbsp;  If yes → rejected permanently



2\. \*\*Does it require operational control?\*\*  

&nbsp;  If yes → out of scope



3\. \*\*Does it compromise auditability?\*\*  

&nbsp;  If yes → rejected



4\. \*\*Does it weaken structural integrity?\*\*  

&nbsp;  If yes → rejected



5\. \*\*Can it be accomplished outside 9DA?\*\*  

&nbsp;  If yes → build it externally



\### How to Request Scope Expansion



If you believe something should be in scope:



1\. Submit ADR proposal

2\. Include:

&nbsp;  - Why it aligns with 9DA principles

&nbsp;  - Why it cannot be external

&nbsp;  - How it preserves ethics

&nbsp;  - How it maintains audit integrity

3\. Undergo ethics review

4\. Accept that rejection is likely



\*\*Most scope expansion requests will be rejected.\*\*



This is intentional.

\## When to Use Something Else



\### Use Traditional Governance When:

\- You need flexibility over structure

\- You prefer consensus over authority

\- You want lightweight process

\- You can tolerate ambiguity



\### Use Process Documents When:

\- You need operational procedures

\- You want step-by-step guides

\- You need onboarding materials

\- You want team collaboration guidelines



\### Use Monitoring Tools When:

\- You need runtime observability

\- You want operational metrics

\- You need production debugging

\- You want performance tracking



\### Use Security Tools When:

\- You need vulnerability scanning

\- You want penetration testing

\- You need threat detection

\- You want incident response



\*\*9DA does not replace any of these.\*\*



9DA complements them by ensuring the \*\*structure\*\* they operate within is coherent and ethical.



---



\## Future Non-Expansion



The following will \*\*never\*\* be in scope:



\- Product features or capabilities

\- Runtime enforcement mechanisms

\- Surveillance or monitoring infrastructure

\- Behavior manipulation systems

\- Proprietary platform requirements

\- Operational automation

\- User interface components

\- Data collection systems



\*\*This list is non-exhaustive but permanent.\*\*



If it's here, it won't change.



---



\## Final Constraint



If 9DA tries to do everything, it does nothing well.



These non-goals exist to keep 9DA focused on what it does uniquely:



\*\*Govern structure. Enforce ethics. Prove integrity.\*\*



Everything else belongs somewhere else.
