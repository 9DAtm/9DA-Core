\# 9DA Manifesto



9DA exists to prevent structural decay under scale.



Growth without coherence is failure.

Automation without ethics is harm.

Governance without enforcement is theater.



9DA encodes governance as:

\- Deterministic

\- Machine-verifiable

\- Cryptographically attestable



If it cannot be audited, it does not count.
